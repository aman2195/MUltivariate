#Regression on how much is an extra bedroom worth

#First step: Understand your data using three functions

#Summary stats
summary(price)
summary(bedrooms)

#Box plot
boxplot(price)
boxplot(bedrooms)

#Histogram

hist(price)
hist(bedrooms)

#Visualizing relationships

plot(bedrooms, price)

#For this example, we are not splitting the data into training and test
#As an example, we are taking only train data

lm_fit = lm(price~bedrooms)

lm_fit

#Visualize the line
abline(lm_fit, col='red') #Superimposes the predicted line over the scatter plot

confint(lm_model, 'bedrooms', level=0.90)
visreg(lm.fit, alpha=0.05)
